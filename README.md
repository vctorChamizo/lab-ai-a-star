# Lab | Artificial Intelligence - A* search algorithm

## Introduction
A* search algorithm is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.). It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied.

## Documentation
This project aims to implement the A* search algorithm through a program that is executed in the user's browser and which can interact with it to indicate the dimension of the trabler in which the algorithm will be executed, the starting point and end, as well as the different obstacles that you will encounter along the way.

Below is a demo of the running application:
